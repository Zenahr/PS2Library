## CHANGELOG

### 2022-11-05

- added active, fuzzy search

## Why?

- Modern, web-technology based UI (everything is OFFLINE, but the technology used is HTML and CSS)
- Simple to use

I personally tried Specabis and PCSX2Bonus, of which both had some problems or were too elaborate for my lazy ass to set up, so I did what any other sane software engineer would do: make my own.

## Limitations

- Multidisc games are not supported in the UI yet (not too much work left but it takes some time to get done)
- Requires you to put each game into its own folder
- Requires you to download artwork on your own
- Folder configuration is currently done via an INI file which some might perceive as clunky.

## Pros & Features

-  âš¡ Blazingly fast
-  ðŸ˜Ž Good looking UI
-  âš™ Easy to set up

## How does it work under the hood?

I use *Python* as the general language, *Flask* for the UI and *flaskwebgui*, *HTML* and *CSS* for creating and styling the UI.
